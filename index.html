      <img src="./assets/css/images/Screenshot_20190318-184401_LinkedIn.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Your Name">

      <p>I am a 36
          year old techie, who takes pride in solving life issues as they come.
          I consider myself flexible being a jack-of-all-trades doing it all from tech support to being a mentor
          to inner city youth.</p>

          <p>I just happen so to have a passion for technology, so I guess that ties everything
              togther. Based on my dedication and hard work, I bring value to each company i work for. I've been doing so for
              13 years as an adult.</p>

              <p> Outside of my preserverance and resilient attitude, I'm also a loving family man who provides. other than
                  providing, I try to educate not only my children, but in other people I care about. It's because of them I
                  displayed a never say die attitude about reinventing myself to be a better man.</p>
