      <p>I am a full-stack web developer, and a back-end enthusiast! In fact, this entire portfolio is built in my own
        CSS framework!
        I am experienced in HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, Bulma, Node, Express, Git, Mongodb, React,
        mySQL, and sequelize.</p>


      <p>I have built projects individually and as a team.
        While I enjoy front-end development, I am extremely passionate about creating a super-functional and intuitive
        back-end user experience. </p>


      <p>I am a life-long learner. I am driven to learn cutting-edge technologies and master those with which I am
        already familiar.
        I am currently building a STEM program for adults continuing education on a post-high school level, before
        deciding I wanted to learn web development.
        The same desire to learn and grow that contributed to my success in the classroom led me to enter and complete a
        full-time web development bootcamp at UNC Charlotte.
        I am currently an intern at a rehabilitation-vocational institution for those returning to society, but I am
        still looking for a full-time front end or full-stack position.</p>
